# README - Automated Message Sending with Mobile Connect√©e / Link to Windows

## Description
This script utilizes Selenium to automate message sending via **Mobile Connect√©e / Link to Windows**. It reads phone numbers from a `numbers.txt` file and sends predefined messages to each contact.

‚ö† **Warning**:
- **Do not overuse this tool**! It is limited to a maximum of **400 different recipients** to prevent being blocked by Microsoft.
- It works **only on Windows**.
- **A laptop is required** since you need to scan a QR code for the first login.

## Prerequisites
### 1. System Requirements
- **Windows** (this script has not been tested on other OS)
- **Microsoft Edge or Chrome** installed
- **WebDriver for Edge or ChromeDriver** matching your browser version (should be in the PATH or the script folder)

### 2. Required Python Libraries
Ensure you have Selenium installed:
```bash
pip install selenium
```

## Features
1. **First-time connection**:
   - Opens Mobile Connect√©e / Link to Windows in your browser.
   - Requires scanning a QR code for authentication.
   - After logging in, press **Enter** to start sending messages.

2. **Automated message sending**:
   - Reads phone numbers from `numbers.txt`.
   - Selects each contact and sends a predefined message.
   - Default message:
     ```
     Hi, reply if you received this message. I am developing a tool to send thousands of messages to strangers. Here is my Discord: __eeva
     ```
   - **You can modify this message in the script**.

3. **Customizing phone numbers**:
   - The script can send messages to numbers starting with `06` or `07`. You can modify this in `numbers.txt`.
   - If `numbers.txt` does not exist, you can generate numbers using a **Number Generator**.

## Usage
### Step 1: Add phone numbers
Create a `numbers.txt` file in the same directory as the script and add a list of phone numbers (one per line):
```
0601020304
0612345678
0711223344
```

### Step 2: Run the script
#### First login (with graphical interface)
```bash
python script.py
```
üöÄ **Do not use headless mode for the first login!**

#### Subsequent logins (optional headless mode)
Set `user_wants_headless = True` in the script to run it without opening the browser window.

### Step 3: Verification & Best Practices
- **Do not exceed 400 messages** to avoid being blocked.
- **Ensure valid phone numbers are used**.
- **Test with a small number of contacts before sending bulk messages**.

## Common Errors & Troubleshooting
### Error: WebDriver Not Found
- Check if you have downloaded [WebDriver for Edge](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/) or [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) and that its version matches your browser.
- Add WebDriver to your system PATH or place it in the script directory.

### Error: Mobile Connect√©e / Link to Windows Not Loading
- Ensure you have scanned the QR code and are logged into Mobile Connect√©e / Link to Windows.
- Restart the script after verifying your login status.

### Error: The script stops after a few messages
- Microsoft might be restricting your activity. Reduce the message frequency or limit the number of recipients.
- If necessary, use a VPN or try another Microsoft account.

### Error: Input element not found
- Mobile Connect√©e / Link to Windows may have updated its interface. Try updating Selenium and checking the correct XPATH for elements.
